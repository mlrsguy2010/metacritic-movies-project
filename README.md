# metacritic-movies-project

This project was a stand out assignment during my college career. The objective here was to acquire data from the internet via web scraping and then conduct exploratory data analysis on the resultant data set.

The two Jupyter notebooks that make up this project break things down into two major phases. The first phase scrapes data from the Metacritic website and stores the acquired data in a MongoDB database.

The second phase accesses the data stored in the database and conducts the analysis. I chose to focus on keyword comparison of the data set. This produced some really interesting results as I created histograms for various iterations on the theme of "Good vs. Evil"

I enjoyed this project as it tied together a variety of brand new skills that I had never used before.
